# verilog_doc
Idea was to add an auto documentor, simlar to python read-the-docs.
But after some analysis found that fundamentally read-the-docs is useful for python becasue of its API/Library esque style of development.
While verilog on the other hand are not abstract pices of library codes, rather design implementations.
