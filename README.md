# verilog_doc
Idea was to add an auto documentor, simlar to python read-the-docs.
<br>But after putting in some thought I realized that fundamentally read-the-docs is useful for python becasue of its API/Library esque style of development.
<br>While verilog on the other hand are not abstract pieces of library codes, rather design implementations.
